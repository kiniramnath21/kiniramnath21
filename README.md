### 🚀 Projects

#### 🧊 [Ice Cream Sales Predictor](https://github.com/kiniramnath21/ice-cream-sales-predictor) · [Live Demo](https://kiniramnath21-ice-cream-sales-predictor.streamlit.app/)  
Developed a Python + Streamlit web app that forecasts ice cream sales based on temperature and seasonal trends. Includes regression modeling, visualization, and interactive UI.

#### ❤️ [Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/kiniramnath21/Heart-Disease-Prediction)  
Built an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline to predict heart disease risk using the BRFSS 2015 dataset (253k+ records). Performed comprehensive EDA, handled class imbalance using stratified splitting and class weighting, implemented Logistic Regression with hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV), applied threshold optimization to improve recall for high-risk patients, and persisted the trained model for production inference. Compared performance with Random Forest classifier.

#### 📊 [Student Performance Tracker](https://github.com/kiniramnath21/Student-Performance-Tracker-Java)  
Created a Java console-based system to manage students, courses, and grades. Integrated MySQL for persistent storage, supporting full CRUD operations and automated performance reports.

#### 🎬 [Netflix Show Clustering](https://github.com/kiniramnath21/Netflix_Show_Clustering)  
Implemented K-Means clustering on Netflix metadata (genres, ratings, and release year) for unsupervised pattern discovery. Integrated PCA visualization and built an interactive Streamlit dashboard, deployed on AWS EC2 with S3 dataset access.

#### 🐶 [Dog Breed Classification](https://github.com/kiniramnath21/Dog-Breed-Classification)  
Image classification project using Python and ML models to accurately identify dog breeds.
